# This project

Ok so working with node backend there is a problem - there is no MVC pattern like in Laravel. You must build your own.

I created such thing, that lets you:
- Create folder structure i think is needed
- Create controller, model, route file and views subfolder for a given name

Btw, if you need to use it you must use command:
```
npm install -g ./
```sh

Then you use it like this - setup:
```
mvc-node-setup
```sh

Creating of controller, model, views subfolder and routes file:
```
mvc-node-make todo
```sh
